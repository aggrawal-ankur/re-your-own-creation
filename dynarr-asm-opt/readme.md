# Optimizing dynarr.asm

Now I've a fully working handwritten assembly for dynarr.asm. The next thing I want to do is to understand the various optimization tricks that can be applied on this assembly and implement them.

I don't have to do any guess-work because I can take help from GCC itself. I'll read, analyze and understand GCC's output at -O1 and -O2 and implement those tricks in my assembly. That's my next target.
